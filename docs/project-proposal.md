Favorites List: Implement a system to save favorite recipes in a dedicated section for quick and easy access.

Sprint 2 (Week 5-6): Advanced Discovery Tools
Search by Ingredients: Develop a smart search engine that filters and displays recipes based on the ingredients available to the user.
Advanced Smart Filtering: Enhance the filtering system to include specific criteria such as preparation time, calorie count, and meal type.

Sprint 3 (Week 7-8): Social Engagement & Productivity
Social Interaction: Add social engagement features, allowing users to "Like" and "Comment" on recipes shared by others.
Shopping List: Implement a feature that automatically converts recipe ingredients into an interactive digital shopping checklist.

Sprint 4 (Week 9-10): Export & Sharing Features
Share Recipe as Text/Image: Enable users to share recipe details or links via social media and messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp).
Recipe PDF Export: Develop a functionality to convert the recipe details page into a PDF file for local saving or printing.

Sprint 5 (Week 11-12): Polish, Testing, & Bug Fixes
Comprehensive Testing: Conduct thorough testing of all new features, ensuring the accuracy of the "Search by Ingredients" logic and PDF export functionality.
UI Polishing: Refine the user interface and resolve any technical bugs or glitches discovered during the testing phase.

Sprint 6 (Week 13-14): Final Testing & Presentation Prep
Integrated System Testing: Perform a final end-to-end test of the entire application to ensure system stability.

9. Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
[ ] All core features are implemented and working:
    Full Cloud Authentication & Profile management (Firebase).
    Advanced Recipe Management (CRUD) with Cloud Media hosting (Cloudinary).
    Intelligence tools: Search by Ingredients and Smart Filtering (Time/Calories).
    Productivity tools: Offline Mode and Auto-generated Shopping List.
    Engagement tools: Social interactions (Likes/Comments) and PDF Export.
[ ] Users can complete primary workflows without errors:
    Users can register, create a recipe with images, and find it via smart filters.
    Users can successfully convert ingredients to a checklist and use it in offline mode.
    Users can export and share their recipes as formatted PDFs or via social apps.
[ ] Code is well-documented and maintainable:
    Using clean architecture (MVC/MVVM) with clear comments for Cloudinary and Firebase logic.
    Following naming conventions for layouts, classes, and variables.
[ ] Test coverage is at least 70%:
    Unit tests for search algorithms and calorie calculations.
    UI testing (Espresso) for critical flows like registration and recipe creation.
[ ] Application is responsive and user-friendly:
    The UI is optimized for different screen sizes and orientations.
    Using Shimmer effects and Progress bars to ensure a smooth user experience during cloud uploads.

10. Risks and Mitigation
Risk 1: Cloud Storage Quota and Latency
Description: Heavy reliance on Cloudinary for high-quality images might hit free tier limits or cause slow loading times on weak connections.
Mitigation: Implement image compression before uploading and use the Picasso library for efficient image caching and resizing to reduce bandwidth consumption.

Risk 2: Complexity of "Search by Ingredients" Logic
Description: As the database grows, searching through string-based ingredients can become slow or return inaccurate results.
Mitigation: Structure ingredients as an ArrayList in Firestore to use optimized queries and implement a normalized search algorithm to handle typos or similar terms.

Risk 3: PDF Generation and Device Compatibility
Description: Generating PDFs on different Android versions (API levels) can lead to crashes or inconsistent formatting.
Mitigation: Use a robust, well-documented library like PdfDocument or iText, and conduct extensive testing across various Android versions and screen sizes to ensure layout stability.

Risk 4: Offline Data Synchronization
Description: Conflicts may occur when a user modifies "Favorites" while offline and then reconnects to the internet.
Mitigation: Enable Firestore Persistence and implement a "last-write-wins" strategy or timestamp-based synchronization to ensure data consistency between local and cloud storage.

Risk 5: Technical Complexity of Social Interactions
Description: Managing real-time likes and comments can lead to high "Read/Write" costs in Firebase or data desynchronization.
Mitigation: Use Firebase Transactions for incrementing likes to avoid race conditions and optimize Firestore rules to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
